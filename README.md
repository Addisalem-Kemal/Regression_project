# Regression_project

## Project Description:


The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the value of single unit properties that the tax district assesses using the property data from properties sold and purchased from May-August, 2017.

## Goals
The goals of this project is as follows:

A Complete Jupyter Notebook Report showing the step-by-step process of collecting and wrangling data, exploring the possible drivers of     the tax value, run a statistical analysis of various features and finally, model and test the chosen feaures using common regression     techniques.
 
A README.md file containing:

  project description with goals
  a data dictionary
  project planning (a step by step process through the data science pipeline)
  explanation of how this project and its findings can be reproduced
  key findings and takeaways from the project.
  
A wrangle.py file that holds the functions to acquire and prepare the data for machine learning algorithm.

## Project Planning:


### Projet Outline:

  Acquisiton of data through Codeup SQL Server, using env.py file with username, password, and host
  Prepare and clean data with python - Jupyter Labs Notebook
  
  Explore data:
      if value are what the dictionary says they are
      null values
        are the fixable or should they just be deleted
      categorical or continuous values
      Make graphs that show
  Run statistical analysis
  Model data
  Test Data
  Conclude results
  Further recommendations
